Greetings!

New topic on [linear regression](/_learning/machine-learning/3-linear-regression.md) just dropped, get it while it's hot and steamy! This is what I would consider one of the most important topics, since it covers a lot of fundamental concepts that are transversal to much of ML and even other fields.

Cheers!
