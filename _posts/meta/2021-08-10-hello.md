We're doing it. I finally have a personal page blog whatcha-ma-call-it thingy.

I've been meaning to create some introductory material on deep learning for the curious souls with some basic engineering math knowledge out there, and stick it in a github.io page. As I was snooping the GitHub Pages information as a means to host a little webpage, I found that Jekyll was integrated with it.

Now, at the time I had no idea what a Jekyll was, but I was sufficiently motivated and caffeinated to pursue more information. Eureka! As someone who prefers to steer away from web development (or front-end in general), I had found gold! And a few hours of tutorials, documentation, and tinkering later, Jekyll seems to be great.

Though only the inevitable entropy generated by the site's complexity and human error will show how powerful this tool is, I remain hopeful. I will make an honest attempt at creating and maintaining a decent-looking website with quality resources for those who seek knowledge, and some personal info for those who want to learn about me.

I am not yet entirely sure whether I will post educational content, rants, opinions, or a mix of all of these. Stick around to find out.

Cheers!
