Hi! Let's go over the changes in the website that are to come in the following weeks.

1) The 'Learning' area will undergo significant structural changes.

First of all, it is my pleasure to announce that MathJax finally looks cool enough that I'm going to start using it. Both inline and display math will now look a whole lot fancier!

Furthermore, the content itself has been restructured into what I deem to be more appropriate and intuitive to navigate through for newcomers.

2) The '[About](/about.html)' page.

I finally got around to writing a bit about my life and interests. The only thing delaying the update of this page is actually the search for pictures that are relevant therein. However, readers in large enough numbers may persuade me to upload the page even without those pictures; instead, a Kermit the frog placeholder would be used in their behalf.

3) More 'chill' content!

Hey, we need to have fun. I usually like to break down and discuss UFC fights with friends, but some of them have suggested that I start posting some of my thoughts here. I may just start doing that. Heck, I may even dig up old analyses and predictions I did and still post them here. Other than that, if y'all have any suggestions for stuff you'd like me to ramble about, feel free to shoot me a message wherever.

Cheers!
