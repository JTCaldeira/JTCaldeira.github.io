Greetings!

A new topic on [data engineering](/_learning/machine-learning/2-data-engineering.md) is out! It is not meant to be comprehensive, but rather to give the machine learning nerds (that includes me) an overview of what's out there and to motivate the need for data engineering, even we think our models are so powerful we can get away with anything.

Cheers!
