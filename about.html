<h2>Research</h2>

<p>
    We (humans) tend to work with very high-dimensional data such as images, video, etc.
In reality, however, the variability in the data we observe is often explained by a much smaller number of dimensions, which we call “degrees of freedom”.
Discovering a mapping to this lower-dimensional space is a task we call dimensionality reduction.
</p>

<p>
    Methods such as the well-known PCA can only capture linear relationships between features of the data.
    This is why I am currently working on algorithms that represent highly nonlinear mappings from this high-dimensional space to a much lower-dimensional one, hopefully capturing the real degrees of freedom in the data.
