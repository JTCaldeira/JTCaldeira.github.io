<p>I <i>was</i> going to use this page to show the reader a cool stick I found at the park, but I <i>suppose</i> this is a good opportunity to talk a little bit about me and what I like to do.</p>

            Up to 9th grade, I was in a school that had a very strong curriculum in music in addition to the normal subjects; and no, I did not have a lot of free time back then. There, I obtained the 3rd degree in the clarinet and the 5th degree in both the cello and in music theory. We also had classes in classical choir, instrument ensemble, and musical reading and history.

            These days I really just play the guitar, sing, and compose for fun. The occasional studio jam (picture on the right) is the most fun, and getting everyone to agree on which songs to play is a very stimulating group communication exercise.

<p>I like to exercise frequently; usually 5-6 times per week. Though currently I mostly do weightlifting and running, I've been boxing since high school.</p>

            Indeed, boxing is my darling sport. I joined the ranks of Sporting Clube de Portugal and boxed there for a few years hopping between welterweight and middleweight. I was a fan of Sporting's rival team, Benfica, but luckily I was in just the environment where people could settle their differences in the ring (I'm kidding, we all got along). My top 3 boxers of all time are Sugar Ray Robinson, Sam Langford, and Joe Louis; my favorite to watch is "Iron" Mike Tyson. I have also been following MMA (mixed martial arts) for some time and actually plan on starting to write posts discussing UFC (an MMA organization) events.

<p>"Fist fights? That would make you a brute!" - and a well read one, or so I like to think. I've been reading from a very young age, and finished my first book in English in the 5th grade. I have unfortunately remained bilingual ever since, but it is never too late.</p>

            Though Tolkien is a favorite of mine (if you couldn't tell from the picture), I also dabble in more technical books, e.g., Gianfranco Pasquino's <cite>Nuovo corso di scienza politica</cite>. An about year old interest of mine lies in medical sciences, mainly: genomics, metabolism, neuroscience, and nutrition. An awesome read was Lieberman and Long's <cite>The Molecule of More</cite>, which is about everyone's favorite neuromodulator, dopamine. I am studying from <cite>Mathematics for Machine Learning</cite>, and will be posting my <a href="https://github.com/JTCaldeira/Mathematics-for-Machine-Learning-Solutions">solutions</a> on GitHub as I go. I'm currently reading Tolkien's <cite>Silmarillion</cite>.

<blockquote>
    <p>I don't know half of you half as well as I should like; and I like less than half of you half as well as you deserve.</p>
</blockquote>

and

<blockquote>
    <p>Not all those who wander are lost.</p>
</blockquote>

are some of my favorite quotes from <cite>The Fellowship of the Ring</cite>. Indeed, I believe that every person's perspective of the World and its affairs is made all the richer by their story and path. As such, I strive to make my own path as interesting as possible; alas, "even the very wise cannot see all ends" (Gandalf).

<p>Below are a few pictures of a particularly fun weekend in 2019, in which I took part in a hackathon called BreakingDev. Amidst getting to be a proper nerd for 48h straight, leading the "Saucy Goats" to victory, and dressing up as a duck, there is much to remember from this event.</p>

<p>And finally, because no blog-personal-page-thing would be complete without travel pictures, here I am being a mischievous scallywag in Venezia, Napoli, the Costa Vicentina, and Rome, respectively.</p>
