I am currently reading the book [*Mathematics for Machine Learning*](https://mml-book.github.io/book/mml-book.pdf), which is *absolutely wonderful*. I will be posting my solutions to the problem sets in a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/JTCaldeira/Mathematics-for-Machine-Learning-Solutions), which I encourage fellow readers to check out and criticize.

As a CS student who barely got by in their maths classes, this book has been absolutely phenomenal at giving me the knowledge to understand the mathematics that are the backbone to ML. Though you the book PDF is made freely available online, I bought the print version and have no regrets: it is easily one of the highest quality books I've had.
