While machine learning and computation itself are spawns of the very broad field of mathematics, this section is reserved for material that attempts to introduce some useful intuition on topics related to (or directly used in) ML.

In this section, you will find some math that is either:
- Required in order to understand certain parts of ML
- A deeper dive into a particular part of ML
- Something I find interesting or useful
