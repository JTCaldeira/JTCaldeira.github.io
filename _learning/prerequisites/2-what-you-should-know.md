The current section (Prerequisites) describes the mathematical knowledge base you should be familiar with if you want to understand the basics of machine learning. In a broad stroke, these are the concepts you should be somewhat comfortable with:

- Linear Algebra
	+ Matrix multiplication as a transformation
	+ Determinants
	+ Eigenvalues and eigenvectors
	+ Linear transformations
	+ Matrix decomposition
	+ Basis/orthogonal basis
	+ Vector spaces and normed spaces
- Calculus
	+ Differentiation and integration
	+ Finding minima and maxima
	+ Partial derivatives
	+ Chain rule
	+ Gradients
- Probability Theory/Statistics
	+ Probability measures
	+ Conditional probability
	+ Bayes theorem
	+ Bayesian statistics
	+ Law of total probability
	+ Probability distributions and their functions
	+ Discrete and continuous distributions

This list is probably not comprehensive, but it includes everything that comes to mind at the time of writing. As content is published, I will update the above list with the necessary material.

If you're already familiar with machine learning, you might notice some things are missing from the above list. Information theory, maximum likelihood, etc. will have their own tutorials published in the Maths section.
