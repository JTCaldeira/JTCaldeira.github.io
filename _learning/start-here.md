### Preface

Though I'm currently planning to focus on content related to machine learning (ML), I can't promise I will not post about other cool computer science stuff I find interesting.

However, since ML is indeed "my thing", you can read through the rest of the material in this area of the website assuming it to be the matter at hand. Though the aim is for each topic in ML to be as self-contained as possible, reading the topics in order is recommended. This does not apply to the Deep Learning and Maths sections.

### What is Machine Learning?

Unlike "natural intelligence", as displayed by humans and many animals, Artificial Intelligence refers to intelligence demonstrated by machines. Among its objectives are the fields of search, planning, knowledge reasoning and, the most dominant one, Machine Learning (ML).

There are three types of ML:
- Supervised learning: with a teacher (labeled data)
- Unsupervised learning: without a teacher (unlabeled data)
- Reinforcement learning:
	+ Without a teacher
	+ Actions and responses from the environment

The plan is to focus on supervised learning in the beginning of the development of the content, but the other two are definitely on the roadmap.

### Prerequisites

This section describes the mathematical knowledge base you probably should be familiar with if you want to understand the basics of ML. In a broad stroke, these are the concepts you should be somewhat comfortable with already:

- Linear Algebra
    + Vector spaces
	+ Matrix multiplication as a transformation
	+ Determinants
	+ Eigenvalues and eigenvectors
	+ Linear transformations
	+ Matrix decomposition
	+ Basis/orthogonal basis
- Calculus
	+ Differentiation and integration
	+ Finding minima and maxima
	+ Partial derivatives
	+ Chain rule
	+ Gradients
- Probability Theory/Statistics
	+ Probability measures
	+ Conditional probability
	+ Bayes theorem
	+ Bayesian statistics
	+ Law of total probability
	+ Probability distributions and their functions
	+ Discrete and continuous distributions

This list is probably not comprehensive, but it includes everything that comes to mind at the time of writing. As content is published, I will update the above list with the necessary material. Furthermore, while not *every* topic above is required for *every* aspect of ML, these concepts were deemed by me to either be a stepping stone for more advanced material, or of enough transversal importance to be a "prerequisite".

If you're not comfortable with the material listed above, here are some suggestions for places where you can learn/review it:

- Linear Algebra
	+ 3Blue1Brown's [essence of linear algebra](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab) playlist (**strongly recommended**)
	+ MIT Open Courseware
	+ Stanford linear algebra [review notes](http://cs229.stanford.edu/section/cs229-linalg.pdf)
- Calculus
	+ 3Blue1Brown's [essence of calculus](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr) playlist
	+ MIT Open Courseware
	+ Khan Academy
- Probability Theory/Statistics
	+ [StatQuest](https://www.youtube.com/user/joshstarmer) on YouTube
	+ Stanford probabilities [review notes](http://cs229.stanford.edu/section/cs229-prob.pdf)
    + Harvard's [stats 110](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/stat110/strategic-practice-problems)

That's it for an introduction, off you go!
