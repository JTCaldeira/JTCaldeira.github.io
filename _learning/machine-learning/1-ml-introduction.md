Welcome to the Machine Learning section!

First order of business is to publish some content on the more basic/popular supervised learning techniques. I do, however, plan on creating some unsupervised and reinforcement learning material along the road.

Some might notice a whole separate section for Deep Learning, even though it is a part of Machine Learning. I chose to separate it from the rest of ML due to the depth I intend on taking that topic to.
